- Josue Reyes Web Portfolio'
Systems Engineer

This repository contains the source code of my web portfolio, which is developed with NextJS, Tailwind CSS and Framer Motion and deployed in Netlify. In this portfolio, I present my skills, experience and outstanding projects in the field of software development.

My goal is to showcase my technical skills and the projects I have worked on, as well as provide a platform for potential employers and collaborators to learn more about my work.
